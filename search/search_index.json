Material \u00b6 For the tests, the MDF (Medium-density fibreboard) with a thickness of 3 mm was used. Sofware \u00b6 The laser cutter model is Duplotech 1080 and its software is called RDWorks (RDCAM) . It can support .dxf and . bitmap files. Here is its interface. Focus \u00b6 The laser cutter has a manual focus. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the distance between the material surface and the laser nozzle must be 6 mm. Therefore, we placed a 6 mm thick piece of acrylic on top of the MDF sheet and let the laser nozzle touch it (the two screws highlighted in the picture below can be handled to allow the cannon to be free/fixed). Setting test (power, speed, rate) \u00b6 To get a better sense of what the best parameters are for cutting and engraving we developed two tests, one of power(%) vs speed(mm/s) for testing cutting parameters and another one with interval(mm) vs power(%) using a fixed speed of 350mm/s to test engraving parameters. We set different parameters up divided by colors. You can download the setting test file here . The results after cutting and engraving in 3mm MDF Kerf Test \u00b6 In this file were drawn some 15 mm diameter circles. Each color was set up with a different power (%). And the first row was cut with a speed of 5 mm/s and the second 15 mm/s. You can download the kerf test file here . There isn\u2019t that much of a difference changing the parameters. The calculated kerf is around 0.225mm and 0.275mm . Joint clearance test \u00b6 Setting value: power 70%, speed 15mm/s. You can download the joint clearance test file here .

The process consists of the arrangement of successive layers to create the object and each layer can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object. 3D Printer - Ultimaker 2+ \u00b6 The Insper Fab Lab is equipped with two models of 3D printers, the Ultimaker 2+ and a Zmorph 2.0 SX . For this group assignment we used the Ultimaker printer to test the design rules and document its limits. Here are the equipment specifications: Print technology: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Build volume : 230 x 225 x 205mm Filament diameter: 2.85 mm Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm Print speed: 30 mm/s - 300 mm/s Supported Filaments: PLA and ABS. Overall Size: 357 x 342 x 388mm File Transfer: Standard SD card Printing Software: Cura Preparing for printing in the Cura \u00b6 To fulfill the requirements of this assignment, I used the 3D Printer Test Models created by Make Magazine . It is possible to download the files here . The test models avaiables in those files are: Dimensional Accuracy Bridging Performance Overhang Performance Negative Space Tolerance Fine Positive Features Performance XY Resonance Z Resonance I imported the files into Cura , a software developed by Ultimaker where is possible to set up the printing configurations and parameters. I set up the printing for PLA material and with the following parameters: Layer Height: 0.15mm Wall Line Count: 4 Top Layers: 6 Bottom Layers: 6 Infill Density: 15% Infill Pattern: Grid Print Speed: 45mm/s Build Plate Adhesion Type: Raft Here is a preview from Cura of the printing showing that it going to take almost 10 hours of printing. I exported a .gcode file to a SD Card and pluged in it into the printer. From the main menu I selected the \"print\" option followed by the selection of the .gcode file. The buildplate and the hotend will start to heat up until 60\u00b0C and 200\u00b0C respectively (temperatures set up for PLA material) and as soon the temperature is reached, the printing process will start. By the end of the process, I got the following result: Unfortunately, I notice that some shapes from this print did not came up as I expected. On the the dimension accuracy model and the negative space tolerance model the cylinders did not came out rounded but with an elliptical shape. This happened cause the axis and belts from the printer were not aligned and tied enough. Then I needed to adjust them and repeat the printing process. After disassembling, cleaning, aligning and assembling the printer again, I printed the testers one more time and got a better result. With that issue fixed, I could evaluate the testers that were printed. Dimensional Accuracy \u00b6 The Dimensional Accuracy test came out as expected. After fixing the alignment issue that resulted in a elliptical body, the second printed tester came out rounded as planned and with the dimensions according to the digital model. Here it is the dimensions of the digital model: Here it is the dimensions of the printed part: Bridging Performance \u00b6 The Bridging Test also presented good results. The bridges were formed in all levels, but got a better finishing with the first and second one. I would recommend brigdings considering those distances.","title":"Group Assignment"},{"location":"6Group/#group-assignment","text":"Test the design rules for your 3D printer(s) Document your work and explain what are the limits of your printer(s) (in a group or individually).","title":"Group Assignment"},{"location":"6Group/#3d-printing","text":"3D printing is a process of fabricating a three dimensional objects through a 3D digital model created in a Computer-Aided Design software (CAD).
